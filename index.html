      <h2>What is Car Shipping?</h2>
      <p>Car shipping is the process of transporting a vehicle from one location to another, typically using specialized auto carriers. Whether you're moving across the country or buying a vehicle online, car shipping can save time and effort.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Two Key Players: Brokers and Carriers</h2>
      <p>The car shipping process mainly involves two roles: <strong>brokers</strong> and <strong>carriers</strong>. While they work together to get your vehicle from point A to B, they have very different responsibilities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Does a Broker Do?</h2>
      <p>Brokers, like <a href="https://www.amerifreight.net">AmeriFreight</a>, act as intermediaries. They connect customers with reliable carriers, negotiate prices, and manage the logistics of the shipment. They donâ€™t own trucks but ensure your car is handled by the right transporter.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>What is a Carrier?</h2>
      <p>Carriers are the companies that physically transport your vehicle. They own the trucks and equipment necessary for auto shipping. Carriers are selected by brokers based on route availability, reputation, and service quality.</p>
    </section>
